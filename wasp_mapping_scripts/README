These scripts run the mapping portion of WASP to measure allelic imbalance. The following files are contained here.

The WASP Git repo can be found here: github.com/bmvdgeijn/WASP


run_all.py:
Runs the full pipeline within this folder.

01_intersect_snps.sh
Step 1: Finds reads that intersect with the SNPs of interest.

02_remap_bowtie.sh
Step 2: Remap reads from step 1 to a reference genome after replacing SNP position with alternate alleles.

03_filter_reads.sh
Step 3: Remove any reads that mapped to multiple positions during step 2.

04_merge_bams.sh
Step 4: Merge the mapped reads that we kept from remapping with those that did not intersect any SNPs in step 1.

05_filter_duplicate_reads.sh
Step 5: Filter out duplicate reads, randomly choosing the read to keep.

06_variant_calling.sh
Step 6: Use mpileup to call variants to produce an input VCF file for asereadcounter.

07_adjust_header.sh
Step 7: Adjust the header of output BAM files from step 5 so that ASEReadCounter can read them.

08_asereadcounter.sh
Step 8: Use ASEReadCounter to count the reads mapped to SNPs.
